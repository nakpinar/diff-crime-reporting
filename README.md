and includes everything required to simulate synthetic crime data, fit Spatio-Temporal Point Process models and Moving Average models for hot spot prediction, and evaluate and plot equity results between districts at the example of Bogot√°, Colombia. All data and outputs for an example run of the whole simulation pipeline are included.
